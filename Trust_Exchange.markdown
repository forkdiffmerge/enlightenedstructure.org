_Superseding the Scarcity Economy_

The Trust Exchange utilizes the network of trust relationships that already 
exist, making them visible, interlinked and actionable.  Most of our decisions 
are based on collective opinions and discernment, particularly those of friends 
we trust.  The Trust Exchange brings visibility to your friends’ ratings of 
products, companies, websites, and more.  In turn, you can rate your trust 
level of a friend or information source in any category, where categories are 
simply user-created tags.  One friend you may trust for their computer knowledge 
and another for their culinary capacity.

The Trust Exchange amalgamates existing ratings from any source, feeding them 
into an open platform.  Instead of owning your ratings and trust information, 
like existing online networks and organizations, the Trust Exchange is a simple 
and powerful open platform for humanity to exchange its trust information. 
 Individuals can choose whether to make ratings publicly available, or share 
them privately with trusted friends.

The purpose of the Trust Exchange is to support and facilitate the era of transparency 
that is emerging.  Anyone doing research on a purchase can tap into the publicly 
available ratings of relevant companies to help them choose a product or supplier 
aligned with their own values.  Corporations, too, can become model citizens 
when social capital is tied closely enough to revenue.  The engine of capitalism 
then becomes an engine for systemic self-improvement.

## Solutions to our Biggest Issues

Corporations tend to pursue profit, often disregarding the good of the communities 
and the planet. There is a promising movement in the corporate world toward 
social and environmental responsibility.  This trend could be greatly accelerated 
by increasing transparency and allowing consumers to “vote” with their dollars. 
If customers were directly telling a corporation when they were (and were not) 
purchasing from them, then both the corporation and the shareholders would 
see that, even from a pure profit motive, it is in their best interest to move 
toward the values of the consumer.

In the political realm, citizens suffer from a lack of transparency, getting 
their information from sources they don’t really trust, simply because trusted 
information is not readily available. The Trust Exchange would make highly 
rated news media (text, audio, video) readily accessible by filtering it through 
your trust network.

## Who Benefits

Unlike today’s (mostly proprietary) rating systems, the public at large can 
benefit from the ratings exposed through the Trust Exchange. We do not propose 
to build another silo of proprietary information. We propose to build the network 
that links existing trust ratings together and inspires people to create new 
ratings and thereby sharing their valuable knowledge with their friends.

Anyone doing research on a purchase could tap into the publicly available ratings 
of relevant companies to help them choose a product or supplier aligned with 
their own values. Users with rich online social networks would benefit even 
more by inheriting ratings created by their trusted contacts. Corporations 
and governments will have much better information about the real desires and 
priorities of their customers and citizens.

## Initial Steps

* Define a simple standard for exchanging ratings
* Define a "microformat" to expose ratings from any site
* Create a free, open source crawler to collate ratings
* Create a free, open source Trust Exchange web application, which can be used to gather trust ratings for a given organization. Any site could collect trust ratings from its users, either by dropping a Trust Exchange widget into their existing site code, or by installing the free Trust Exchange web application.
* Create a coalition of leading social networking and search companies, willing to implement the Trust Exchange protocol, and allow their users to share trust data across networks.
* Add Trust Exchange ratings from your community to product, news, and media search results

## Optimal Outcome & Measuring Success

Level one of success: popular product search sites have integrated trust exchange 
ratings from the trust network of the current user.

Level two: influential organizations publish amalgamations of ratings from 
individuals and other organizations, which begin to have noticeable impact 
on the stock market.

Level three: the Trust Exchange begins to have an impact on elections - as 
your trust network automatically percolates its recommendations to you.
